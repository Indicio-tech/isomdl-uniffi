# Cargo audit configuration
# This file allows temporary ignoring of certain vulnerabilities during remediation

[advisories]
# Temporarily ignore vulnerabilities while we work on alternatives
ignore = [
    # paste is unmaintained but still functional - used by uniffi

    # proc-macro-error is unmaintained but comes from deep dependency chain

# RESOLVED ISSUES:
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0127: serde_cbor removed in favor of ciborium
# - Updated isomdl dependency to latest version (0.2.0) which may resolve owning_ref
# - Fixed deprecated API usage with allow annotation

# NOTE: cargo-audit automatically uses .cargo-audit.toml in the current directory
# Some vulnerabilities are in deep dependency chains and require upstream fixes
