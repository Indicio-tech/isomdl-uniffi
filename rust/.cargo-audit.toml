[advisories]
# IGNORED VULNERABILITIES (handled via CI command line flags):

# RUSTSEC-2024-0436 - paste crate unmaintained
# - Used by uniffi for macro generation
# - Still functional, security risk is minimal for build-time usage
# - Waiting for uniffi to migrate or provide alternative

# RUSTSEC-2024-0370 - proc-macro-error unmaintained  
# - Deep transitive dependency from json-ld ecosystem
# - Used only at compile time, no runtime security impact
# - Waiting for upstream json-ld dependencies to migrate

# RUSTSEC-2023-0071 - RSA timing attack vulnerability
# - Affects both rsa 0.6.1 (from ssi-jwk) and rsa 0.9.8 (direct dependency)
# - Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels
# - Waiting for rsa 0.10 stable release and ecosystem migration
# - Risk is low as library primarily handles mDL verification, not key generation

# RUSTSEC-2022-0040 - owning_ref soundness issues
# - Deep dependency: owning_ref -> json-ld-* -> ssi-* -> isomdl -> isomdl-uniffi  
# - Soundness issues in unsafe code, but isolated to JSON-LD processing
# - Waiting for json-ld ecosystem to migrate away from owning_ref
# - Risk mitigated by limited usage scope in mDL context

# All ignored issues are in transitive dependencies and require upstream fixes
# None affect the core mDL verification functionality of this library

# RESOLVED ISSUES:
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0127: serde_cbor removed in favor of ciborium
# - Fixed deprecated API usage with allow annotation

# CURRENT IGNORED ISSUES:
# All ignored vulnerabilities are in deep dependency chains from the isomdl crate
# and require upstream ecosystem fixes. These are low-risk for this library's use case.

# Some vulnerabilities are in deep dependency chains and require upstream fixes
