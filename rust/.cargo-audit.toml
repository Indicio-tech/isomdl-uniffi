# Cargo audit configuration
# This file allows temporary ignoring of certain vulnerabilities during remediation

[advisories]
# Temporarily ignore vulnerabilities while we work on alternatives
ignore = [
    # paste is unmaintained but still functional - used by uniffi
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0436",
    # proc-macro-error is unmaintained but comes from deep dependency chain  
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0370",
    # RSA timing attack - waiting for stable 0.10 release (RC available but not stable)
    "RUSTSEC-2023-0071",
    # owning_ref has soundness issues - comes from json-ld dependencies in isomdl crate
    # Deep dependency chain: owning_ref -> json-ld-* -> ssi-* -> isomdl -> isomdl-uniffi
    # Waiting for upstream fixes in json-ld ecosystem

# RESOLVED ISSUES:
# - RUSTSEC-2021-0127: serde_cbor removed in favor of ciborium
# - Fixed deprecated API usage with allow annotation

# CURRENT IGNORED ISSUES:
# All ignored vulnerabilities are in deep dependency chains from the isomdl crate
# and require upstream ecosystem fixes. These are low-risk for this library's use case.

# NOTE: cargo-audit automatically uses .cargo-audit.toml in the current directory
# Some vulnerabilities are in deep dependency chains and require upstream fixes
